# Guide to working with Ben Zohar

# Personal stuff and fun facts

- I grew up in France 🇫🇷, lived for a bit in Scotla󠁧nd, then moved to Canada 🇨🇦 about 6 years ago, currently living in Montréal, Qc.
- I traveled to 49 countries and speak fluently French and English. I understand and speak a little of German, Spanish, bits of Portuguese, and a lot less of Japanese.
- In my free time, I rock climb, create fun little apps and enjoy listening to electronic music. I play piano, guitar, ukulele, and a bit of drums. I also started enjoying free diving which, along with meditation, helps me find my inner calm. My current static apnea record is 5min 05 seconds.
- I can do fun sounds with my mouth, but never got around to recording videos for it so my youtube channel is empty. Maybe this year? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- A few months ago I started recording one second of my life every day, if you have a few minutes to spare, [here’s a playlist of my last months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOM6vFPnrrI&list=PL0ZTVep8zUAU4dNggqmgGYYhDbpadTvH1&index=1&ab_channel=BenZohar), so you can see what my life looks like.

# Why I code

Building apps is the same for me as being an artist. Artists need to train their skills to achieve their best work. I did that, while enjoying every moment of it.

I have been a dev since I was 14 (I built my [first website](http://chatruch.free.fr/) on Adobe PageMill…), and basically never stopped doing it.

When I was living in France, I was CTO of a 100ish people company. That’s when I realized my true passion came from writing code, not managing people. And since I moved to Montreal I have non-stop created apps and websites at nights and weekends, for fun. 

This is why I think I have a “startup” profile. I want to build amazing things, I thrive in users loving the products I’m building. I also find some sort of comfort in being in the zone. Just like meditation, you focus your mind on one thing. Except that thing is not a simple act like breathing, it’s a very complex system with lots of dependencies. And I **absolutely** love that!

# How I work

I sometimes have the “blank page” syndrome, where I can’t be productive. I call it [le creux de la vague](https://translate.google.ca/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=le%20creux%20de%20la%20vague&op=translate), in French. 🌊

It basically means there’s no average day for me, it’s either all up or all down. And it comes in waves, that can last hours or days. I usually use my “down” time to do mundane things, like reading emails, attending meetings, or catching up on the tech news. My “up” time, on the other hand, is **very very very** productive. 

I know it’s not ideal, but I also know I can’t change it (I’ve tried multiple “focus techniques”, without success), so I started working around it. With flexible work hours it became much easier. The upside is, that Arcade is not losing my “up” time, the downside might be that I would work at unpredictable hours sometimes.

My current estimated up/down ratio is between .7 and .8, which means I’m very productive only 70 to 80% of the time.

I might have a bit of undiagnosed ADHD too. I took some test online that told me I had it but never got around seeking medical help for it since it’s not impacting my life in a bad way.

# Meetings

Spending too much time in meetings is a real “wave killer” for me. I’m not just unproductive during the meetings, I’ll probably be unproductive for the following hours.

However, I believe there are 2 different kinds of meetings that are necessary and actually help me get shit done:

- **Syncs** (or however you call it), for when you want to know what your team is doing. It is really important because, besides bringing me context, it also shows me I’m not alone in this and motivates me further.
- **Coffee chats / casual 1:1s**: In this remote-first era, it’s hard not to miss offices (I do.). I think that meeting your teammates in a casual manner is essential to build team spirit, to gain trust with them and also to feel part of the team.

# Documentation

I truly believe that having proper documentation can help any company a lot. Not only for the people already working for it, but also for the next hires. “Where can I get that info?” is a question I asked too many times, where it should have “just” been available to me.

That’s why I think it’s crucial to have a centralized documentation “center” which links to any other existing documentation, and which has to be the easiest to go through. It’s not just about [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor#:~:text=The%20%22bus%20factor%22%20is%20the,disappearing%20suddenly%20from%20the%20project.), but also about:

- reducing the amount of time and annoyance of asking for information from your teammates
- uncluttering your own memories from things you can just go check on later if necessary

I also think of PRs as a part of the documentation. It is the living explanation of code changes and goes a long way when trying to figure out how/why we decided to do something. 

*git blame + descriptive PR = ❤️*

# Communication

### Radical Candor

After I moved to Montreal, I had some kind of a life crisis and realized that I wasn’t honest with people around me, nor with myself. That’s when everything changed for me. I pledged to Radical Candor. It means I will **always** be honest with everyone, including you. Every one of my relationships is now based on trust and honesty and I would never go back!

Radical Candor [is different than Brutal Honesty](https://www.radicalcandor.com/radical-candor-not-brutal-honesty/) in a way that even though I’ll be honest with you, I’ll never be aggressive, nor miss empathy. This is really important to me and I expect the same level of honesty from the people I work with. 

For me, this is the only way to build real trust in each other and to be the most productive in building our product.

At the same time, we are only people and make mistakes. If I make a mistake, please feel free to tell me. I usually own my mistakes, but if you notice I don’t, please be upfront about it. I will always be glad you were. 🙏

### Emojis and [joie de vivre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joie_de_vivre) 🤪

I’m a person who uses too many emojis when in written context. I believe it’s mostly due to the way I am in life. I try to smile as much as I can, because a smile can go a long way. I embrace life and am a “glass half full” kind of person. 

I’ve been known to be the “smiley face” in meetings, the guy that adds a little fun in it. I do this because I believe building a fun product requires us to have fun doing it. It takes a while to evaluate how much fun is “acceptable” in a team, and how much we need, so bear with me while I find the right balance 😉

# Feedback and Pet Peeves

I only have one, **lack of honesty**. 

Whatever happens in life, I believe we can work with it as long as we tell things to each other. That works for personal and professional life.

Every feedback is **good** feedback in my eyes. I like feedback to be frequent and direct!
