## Solo Backpacking Pro-tips


- Always carry a padlock that's thin enough to fit through small holes of hostel dorm's lockers (padlock with code is better if you don't want to carry your keys around)
- Always have multiple credit cards (ideally a visa and a mastercard)
- Bring at least 3 ziplock bags and try tu put all your leaky stuff in it
- Bring a "day" backpack (some are super thin and can be carried easily, see decathlon) I personally have a waterproof bag, it's a bit bigger to carry but really useful for the beach (https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07NNT2FGV)
- Bring your driving license, even if you're not sure you'll drive (this can help not leaving your passport in random places)
- A hostel storage room is usually safer than leaving your bag in the dorm
- Take cash out of ATM at the airport: usually cheaper than currency exchange, even with ATM fees
- Buy a sim card when you arrive, in latam countries it's cheaper than 2 days of roaming. (Or get an eSim in advance with Airaloo)
- If you have a recent iPhone, move your canadien simcard to an e-sim in advance, that way you can keep your number, receive texts etc and use internet on the new sim card
- Anything damp in your bag will start to rot in 3 days if you leave it there
- download maps of your countries offline in your google maps in advance, wifi is *always* shitty 
- download netflix episodes on your phone before going to the airport, airport wifi is often shitty
- get noise cancelling headphones or airpods: this changes EVERYTHING. You'll be much less tired after the flight(s)
- when meeting people, either use their instagram (so you can remember who they are later based on their photos), or use the "QR code scanning" from whatsapp, it will save you a lot of time (and you don't have to ask their name again :D)
- NEVER trust that you'll "see each other again" in a hostel, people come and go, if you want to spend time with someone take their number/insta right away ;) 
- if you can stretch it, I recommend buying merino wool t-shirts: you only have to wash them a few times during your trip (see https://unboundmerino.com/)
- Bring "manual" detergent (most of hostel let you do a laundry but it's still useful)
- Get a distinctive bag for your dirty clothes: you'll separate them from clean cloth when packing, and then you can give the back to the laundry and know it's yours.
- bring a pen in the plane for immigration documents
- bring a power pack: the bigger the better. I have one that can charge my phone 7 times, I always use it in dorms, so you can sleep with your phone next to you, and then plug the battery anywhere during the day, no one is stealing a battery, but phones are another story. I had this one for 5 years, it literally saved my life: https://www.amazon.ca/Portable-Charger-Anker-PowerCore-20100mAh/dp/B00X5RV14Y (there might be better ones now, but take at least 20000 mAh)
- constantly share your location with family or friends, feels safer when you're in the middle of nowhere (also my mom always feels better when she sees my dot moving :D)
- bring a foldable towel in the plane or bus: they are always so cold for some reason. You can use it as a blanket or a pillow. (this one saved my life a couple of times: https://www.decathlon.ca/en/p/8584434/swimming-microfibre-towel-size-xl-blue )
- Try to leave your home keys to a friend, that way you don't have to worry about going home even if you loose your bag, also you don't have to carry your keys everywhere.
- When travelling by bus, use busbud.com it's 1$ more expensive but you skip the line at the counter and you arrive at the bus station ready to board.
- A kindle is much more easy to carry than 3 books. (also use "Calibre" which is an app that allows you to add any downloaded book to your kindle, saves you a lot of money)
- Print 2 copies of your passport and hide them in 2 different places at the bottom of your bags
- Bring a big water bottle: you'll prevent buying too many plastic bottles and you can often fill it up for free at hostels. (the water bottles with a straw tend to overflow in planes, be careful)
